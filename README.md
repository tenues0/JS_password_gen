This JavaScript project generates a password after asking the user specific criteria:

1) If the user wants numbers in the password,

2) If the user wants special characters in the password,

3) If the user wants lowercase letters in the password,

4) If the user wants uppercase letters in the password.

Once all the questions are answered the JavaScript code generates a random password and prints it to the screen.
